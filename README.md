# Claim your Linux Plex server from the shell

## Introduction

The Plex Media Server setup requires you to link your new server to your plex.tv account. This is done by initially accessing your server from "the same network" [1]. This can be a little "complicated" on a remote headless server if you have never heard of an "ssh tunnel" before.

The script in this git repo just uses the same mechanics that are used by the official Plex Docker image [2]. In fact, the script is just a refactored version of the Docker script.

## Usage

NOTE: This version of this repository has been specifically updated for Synology NAS running Plex in DSM 7.x. See the [differences in the script here](https://github.com/jerieljan/plex-claim-server/blame/master/plex-claim-server.sh)

1. Make the script executable: `chmod +x plex-claim-server.sh`
2. Get your Plex Claim Code (it's only valid some minutes): https://www.plex.tv/claim/
3. Claim your server: `sudo ./plex-claim-server.sh "$YOUR_CLAIM_CODE"`
4. Restart your Plex Media Server, e.g., go to Package Center, locate Plex Media Server, Stop then Start.

Sidenote: I wasn't able to verify if it mattered, but also do a `chmod 777 "/volume1/PlexMediaServer/AppData/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml"` because the permissions were 700 when it was generated by this script.

## Advanced Usage

Set the environment variable `PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_APPLICATION_SUPPORT_DIR` to tell the script about your non-default Plex setup.
